			<p>Mexico 86, without a doubt, is one of the most memorable World Cups.
			Mexico was the first country to hold two world cups. 52 total matches were
			played in which 132 goals were scored. The games were played in 12 different
			 stadiums and cities.</p> <br>
				<p>	This world cup was the tournament that immortalized Maradona as a legend
			in football history. After making it out of the group stage and advancing
			 to the quarter finals, Argentina faced England. Maradona scored a controversial
			 goal with his hand but called it the “hand of god”. He then went on to
			 score the “goal of the century” as he did a 68-meter run and took on half
 		 of England’s team.</p>
		 <br>
		<p> The final was disputed between West Germany and Argentina.
		  On June 29, 1986, Argentina was crowned as the champion in front of a
			crowd of 114,00 in the historic Estadio Azteca, in Mexico City.</p>

		<div class="text3">
		<p>	The Aztec ball game, known as ullamaliztli, was an ancient Mesoamerican game
			 that may have originated in the ancient Olmec civilization. When the Aztecs
			 settled in a new land, they built two important things to them. The first
			 was a shrine to the god Huitzilopochtli, and the second was a ball court next to the shrine.</p>
			 <br>
<p>	In Mesoamerican mythology the game was essential to the story of two Maya gods
	 Hun Hunahpu and Vucub Hunahpu. The gods were tricked into descending to the
	 underworld, where they were challenged to a ball game. The loser, Hun Hunahpus,
	 had his head cut off, which became a common practice among ancient civilizations. </p>

		 the ball court of the heavens, this being the ball court of the underworld
		 where the sun passed each night. The game represented the battle between
		 day and night, and so was also related to the human blood sacrifices that
		 were intended to keep the sun moving in the sky.

	<div class="text8">The Aztec ball court was known as the tlachtli or tlahco.
		The courts were usually made up of a narrow central aisle with enclosed
		endzones at the ends giving the shape of I. The courts were flat surfaces
		 and were surrounded by walls. The ball courts varied by size throughout
		 the empire Aztec but were between 100 and 200 feet long. Some settlements
		 had more than one court. The courts were often placed by the ceremonial
		 centers, temples, and funerary shrines.

<div class="title9">The <br> Outcome</div>

	<div class="text9"><p>A win or a loss was very much taken to heart. At times, the
		game would turn into an excuse for an assassination or attack. The game might
		 also be used to settle differences between two teams.</p>
		 	<br>
<p>Winners received trophies which included hachas and palmas.
These were often associated with the ceremonial items in the Aztec culture.</p>
		<br>
<p>Since games often had a religious meaning, the losing captain
or sometimes the entire team, were sacrificed to the gods.</p>
